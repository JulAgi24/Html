            The Heineken Experience is an interactive museum and brewery tour located in Amsterdam,
            Netherlands, within the former Heineken Brewery, which dates back to 1867. It offers visitors a deep
            dive into the history, brewing process, and global legacy of Heineken beer. The tour is self-guided,
            allowing guests to explore various multimedia exhibits, including brewing rooms, interactive displays,
            and historical artifacts related to the company’s founder, Gerard Adriaan Heineken.
            <br><br>
            Visitors can learn about the brewing process, from malting and fermentation to bottling, with
            opportunities to touch, smell, and even taste the raw ingredients. The experience also includes a
            beer tasting session where guests can enjoy freshly brewed Heineken beer.
            <br><br>
            One of the highlights of the tour is the interactive games and activities, such as the “Brew Your Ride”
            virtual reality experience, which simulates the beer-making process. The tour concludes with access
            to the rooftop bar, offering panoramic views of Amsterdam while enjoying a complimentary drink.
            <br><br>
            Overall, the Heineken Experience combines education and entertainment, making it a must-visit for
            beer enthusiasts and anyone interested in Dutch brewing history.

                Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter, widely
                regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of Western art.
                Despite his fame today, van Gogh struggled with poverty and mental illness
                throughout his life, selling only a few paintings during his career. His expressive
                use of color, bold brushstrokes, and emotional depth distinguished his works,
                though these innovations were not widely recognized during his lifetime.
                <br><br>
                Van Gogh's early works, such as The Potato Eaters (1885), focused on somber tones
                and depictions of rural life. However, after moving to Paris in 1886, his style shifted
                dramatically as he encountered the vibrant colors and light of the Impressionist
                and Neo-Impressionist movements. His later works, like Sunflowers (1888) and The
                Starry Night (1889), reflect this transformation, characterized by swirling skies, vivid
                colors, and a heightened emotional intensity.

                to the rooftop bar, offering panoramic views of Amsterdam while enjoying a complimentary drink.

                Plagued by mental health issues, van Gogh spent time in psychiatric institutions,
                including a stay in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he painted The Starry Night. He
                died in 1890 from a gunshot wound, widely believed to be self-inflicted. Despite
                his tragic life, van Gogh left behind over 2,000 artworks, which profoundly influenced modern art.
